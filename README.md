# Tiny Renderer

This is a commented re-implementation of the
[TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) project, designed
originally to teach rendering and OpenGL. It's a foray into understanding
computer graphics.

The outputs are processed into
[`.tga`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA) images. They can be
viewed easily [here](http://schmittl.github.io/tgajs/).
